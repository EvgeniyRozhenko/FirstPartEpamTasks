And be less like you
Is be more like me
All I want to do
I'm becoming this
So much more aware
Become so tired
I can't feel you there
I've become so numb
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
